![My helpful shot]({{ site.url }}/images/post/wl4.jpg)

Last weekend I went to artist colony in old shipyard building. I found not only painters, musicians, photographers, sculptors, but also a guy who made 3d printer. As cool as the whole place was. Old building with a lot of alcohol and few hundred drunk artists (to clarify: it was a party) something struck me. 

I wish to build similar community in science and knowledge sharing as they do. Still, something was odd. Every studio was a separate room. It may be nice as it helped to thrive artists by giving them space for their work. At the same time it seemed awful for me. 

Everyone had some creation. What a waste. What could they do if all of them would focus in one space with few projects? What we hope to build at hackerspace is place for teams. I can barely count single hand made projects in hackerspace. 

People are essence. Sharing creative moments with others is something special. Above the picture of mentioned studio with 3d printer. I have to pretend some kind of artism since it's a blog. ; P
