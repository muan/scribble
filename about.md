This blog is for typical old school blog purposes. It’s egoistic, it’s for myself, it’s for keeping English at decent level, it’s for writing down thoughts, it’s for sharing knowledge with some kind of structure which helps me to learn, it’s for memories, it’s for dummy photos helping in pretending some kind of artism, it’s for a personal diary, it’s for writing down trips and maybe hitchhiking adventures, it’s about interests of mine. If you search for a bloger/wannabe influencer/star. I am not the guy. I would start another youtube channel. :P Still, if you find here something you find interesting tell me, take part in discussion. ;) Write a comment. I want to learn from others with similar interest. ;)

I am very proactive person. I love to meet amazing people at interesting events. :) My passions are about tech (especially biohacking ♥) and ways it interacts with society and us. With business, economy and philosophy in the middle of it, making it all happened. Contact me at <a href="mailto:wojtek@kokorzycki.pl">wojtek@kokorzycki.pl</a>
